- Tabs (Evaluations/Attitude) styled properly

## Admin Overview - GOOD
- Dark theme consistent
- Stat counters visible
- Quick Actions cards styled
- System Health bars look good

## Admin GP Stats - NEEDS WORK
- GP cards at bottom are partially visible - dark background with orange/amber names
- Cards have dark glassmorphism style
- Attitude buttons visible but small
- Overall layout is functional

## Evaluations - GOOD
- Dark theme consistent
- Table with proper dark styling
- Game badges (Roulette/Baccarat) visible with colored backgrounds

## Reports - GOOD
- Dark theme consistent

## Key Design Issues Found:
1. GP cards could use more visual polish - attitude buttons need better contrast
2. Some stat numbers could be larger/bolder
3. The Attitude Distribution section is plain text - could use visual bars
