# GP Cards Visual State - Feb 6, 2026

## Current State
- GP cards now have DARK purple/blue glassmorphism background - GOOD!
- Cards have dashed red borders (from CSS gp-card.negative or border styling) - NEEDS FIX
- Card grid is 4 columns on desktop - GOOD
- Attitude buttons (thumbs down, reset, thumbs up) are visible with colored icons
- Footer shows error count and games count
- Names are in purple/violet gradient text - GOOD
- Team names are in muted text - GOOD

## Issues to Fix
1. RED DASHED BORDERS on all cards - should be solid subtle borders
2. Attitude buttons look cramped with small colored squares
3. The checkbox in top-right is hard to see
4. Footer icons (warning, chart) are small and hard to read
5. Overall cards look busy and cluttered

## Design Improvements Needed
1. Remove dashed borders, use solid subtle glass borders
2. Make attitude section cleaner with proper spacing
3. Improve card footer with better icon sizing
4. Add subtle hover effects
5. Make checkbox more visible
