# Current State Notes

## Current checkpoint: 6754fc5d
- Purple theme with glassmorphism
- stat-card and glass-card components added
- Dev server running correctly
- TSC crashes with memory error (not code issue)

## Data Isolation Task
- Need to verify routers.ts uses userId filtering for all non-admin procedures
- db.ts already has userId-filtered variants for most functions
- Need to check which routers still use non-filtered queries

## Design Status
- Homepage: Purple gradient, looks good
- Need to check other pages visually
