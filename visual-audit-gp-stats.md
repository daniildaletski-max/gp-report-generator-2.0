# GP Stats Visual Audit - Feb 6 2026

## Current State (GOOD)
- Premium stat cards (Total GPs, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Total Games) have colored top borders and glassmorphism backgrounds
- Attitude Distribution chart has colored progress bars (green, gray, red) with values
- Attitude Overview shows Top Performers and Needs Attention sections
- GP cards grid visible below with dark cards

## Issues Found
1. Stat card icons (Users, ThumbsUp, Star, ThumbsDown, Activity) are showing but could be more prominent
2. The stat cards look good with gradient top borders (blue, green, gray, red, purple)
3. Charts section looks clean with glassmorphism backgrounds
4. Need to scroll down to see GP cards - they should be visible

## Overall Assessment
The design is significantly improved from the user's screenshot. The glassmorphism cards, colored borders, and progress bars all work well.
