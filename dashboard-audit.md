# Dashboard Design Audit - Feb 6, 2026

## Current State - LOOKS GOOD!
- Dark background with purple/violet glassmorphism cards
- Stat cards have colored left borders (purple, green, orange, amber)
- Icons in colored rounded squares (purple, green, orange, amber)
- Numbers are large and bold in matching colors
- Sidebar is dark with purple accents
- "Generate Report" button has gradient purple background
- Progress bar for evaluation progress
- Top Performers and Performance Distribution cards look clean
- Monthly Performance Overview card at bottom

## Issues Found
1. Stat card numbers could use slightly larger font
2. The "51 pending" badge could be more visible
3. Empty state messages could be more styled
4. Overall design is clean and consistent - GOOD

## Verdict: Dashboard looks GOOD with the purple glassmorphism theme
