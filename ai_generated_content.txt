FULL GOALS THIS MONTH:
The primary goal for Team Nu is to reduce the total monthly error count from 37 to 25 by implementing focused training on common procedural mistakes. Specifically, we will target the top error contributors, Kristina Derkach, Alicia Bel-Haj, and Isabel Köhler, aiming for a 40% individual error reduction across the board. To maintain high standards, we will reward the top three performers—Kristina Derkach, Anastassija Fomenkova, and Valeria Pomerants—with dedicated recognition for their exceptional evaluation scores (22.0/24). Finally, the entire team will participate in a mandatory refresher workshop focused on game performance standards to ensure the average Game Performance Score remains above 9.0/10.

FULL TEAM OVERVIEW:
Team Nu achieved an Excellent performance rating this month with an average score of 20.3/24, bolstered by a near-perfect Appearance average of 11.3/12 and strong attendance across the board. Kristina Derkach, Anastassija Fomenkova, and Valeria Pomerants all tied for the top score of 22.0/24, demonstrating high proficiency in game performance. However, the team recorded 37 total errors, with Kristina Derkach (9 errors), Alicia Bel-Haj (6 errors), and Isabel Köhler (6 errors) needing immediate focus on reducing mistakes despite their high overall scores. While all GPs scored above the threshold of 18.0, efforts must concentrate on minimizing operational errors to maintain this high standard of service.
