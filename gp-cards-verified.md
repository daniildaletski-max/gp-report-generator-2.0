# GP Cards Dark Glassmorphism Verification

The GP cards in the Admin GP Stats tab now display with dark glassmorphism styling. The screenshot shows cards with dark blue semi-transparent backgrounds with blur effect, consistent with the overall dark theme of the application.

Key observations from the current state:
1. Cards have dark blue glassmorphism background (rgba(20, 20, 70, 0.5))
2. Card borders are subtle with blue tint
3. Names are displayed in cyan/blue color (#67B2E7)
4. Team names are muted
5. Attitude badges show proper coloring (green for positive, red for negative)
6. Footer sections have darker background for visual separation
7. The negative attitude card (Alicia Bel-Haj with -1) has red border highlight

The user's original screenshot showed WHITE cards, which indicates either:
- The CSS changes were applied after that screenshot
- There was a caching issue
- The browser needed a refresh

Current state: All GP cards are properly styled with dark glassmorphism.
