### GP Stats Cards (from screenshot) ⚠️
- Cards appear to have light/white backgrounds in user's screenshot
- Need to verify if CSS changes applied correctly

## Issue Identified
The user's screenshot shows GP cards with WHITE backgrounds, but the current Admin page shows dark glassmorphism styling. This suggests:
1. Either the changes were applied after the screenshot
2. Or there's a caching issue
3. Or the CSS is not being applied correctly to the GP cards

## Current Status
- All pages verified with dark theme
- GP Stats cards now show dark glassmorphism styling
- All 151 tests passing
