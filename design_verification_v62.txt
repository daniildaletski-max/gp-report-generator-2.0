Design Verification v62 - Dark Glassmorphism Refinement
=======================================================

HOME PAGE:
- Clean dark background (#0a0a0f)
- Minimalist hero with "Automate your GP evaluations" 
- Purple gradient accent on "GP evaluations"
- Simple navigation (Dashboard, Upload)
- Stats: 90% Time saved, 100% Accurate, 24/7 Available
- Three-step process section
- CTA "Start uploading now"
- Clean footer

DASHBOARD:
- Dark sidebar with navigation
- Dark main content area
- Colorful stat cards (green, blue, purple, orange)
- Bar chart with colored bars (teal, green, orange)
- Detailed statistics table with colored score badges
- Good contrast and readability

ISSUES TO FIX:
- Dashboard sidebar background should be darker/more glass-like
- Some cards may need better glass effect
- Table styling could be improved

Overall the design is now dark and professional.
