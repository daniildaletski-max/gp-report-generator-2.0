# Design State - GP Stats Tab

## Current State (Feb 6, 2026)
- GP Stats tab header: Dark glassmorphism - GOOD
- Stat cards (Total GPs, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Total Games): Dark with colored top borders - GOOD
- Attitude Distribution chart card: Dark with progress bars - GOOD
- Attitude Overview card: Dark with leaderboard sections - GOOD
- GP Cards grid header: Dark with search - GOOD
- Need to scroll down to see individual GP cards

## Issues Found
1. The stat cards look good with colored top accents
2. Chart cards have proper dark styling
3. Need to verify GP individual cards below the fold
4. Overall the GP Stats dashboard looks properly styled now
