# Design Audit v67 - GP Stats Page

## What's Working Well
1. Stat cards now have colored top borders (blue, green, cyan, red, purple) - GREAT
2. Chart cards (Attitude Distribution, Attitude Overview) have dark glassmorphism backgrounds
3. Progress bars for attitude distribution look good with colored fills
4. GP grid container has proper dark background with search input
5. Overall dark theme is consistent

## Issues to Fix
1. GP individual cards still need scrolling to verify - need to check card styling
2. The stat card icons need gradient backgrounds (currently just plain icons)
3. The "Total Games" stat card needs the purple accent color
4. Need to verify GP card hover animations work

## Summary
The premium-stat-card, chart-card, leaderboard, team-comparison, gp-grid CSS classes are now properly defined and rendering. The page looks significantly better with structured glassmorphism cards.
