# Bonus Calculation Rules

## Overview
The Performance Bonus is a monthly reward for consistent, high-quality, and professional performance.
It is paid for every worked hour and is designed to reward focus, accuracy, and reliability on the live tables.

## Bonus Levels
- **Level 1**: €1.50 (gross) per worked hour
- **Level 2**: €2.50 (gross) per worked hour

## Formula
**YOUR BONUS = BONUS RATE (BY LEVEL) × WORKED HOURS**

## Payment Schedule
Bonus for JANUARY is paid in MARCH with February salary (1 month delay)

## Hard Criteria - Good Games (GGs)

### What Are GGs?
GGs = Good Games - measure uninterrupted, error-free performance during the month.
They reflect consistency and attention to detail.

### Calculation
**GGs = Total games played in a month / number of errors**

Example: Dealer A played 5,000 games in a month and made 2 mistakes
→ GGs = 5,000 / 2 = 2,500

### Important Rule
**The first mistake is always 'free'**, meaning 0 or 1 mistake are treated the same.
If you have 0 or 1 mistake, all your games count toward your GGs total.

### Minimum GG Requirements
- **Level 1**: minimum 2,500 GGs
- **Level 2**: minimum 5,000 GGs

## Professional Standards
To remain eligible for the bonus, presenters are expected to maintain professional performance:
- Excellent performance on live tables
- Correct makeup, posture, and on-camera presence
- Following all rules and procedures
