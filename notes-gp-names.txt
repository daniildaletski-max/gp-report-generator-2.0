GP Names Format Analysis:

The GP names in the database are already stored as FULL NAMES (First + Last):
- Agnes Suvorov
- Akemi Hashimura
- Alina Jivoloup
- Alina Kudashova
- Alisa Alokhina
- Anastasija Kalašnikova
- Andrea Arsova
- Anna Maslova
- Annaliisa Jerlakas
- Anya Kiisk
- etc.

The chart generation code already uses gp.gpName which contains the full name.
The issue might be that the chart labels are being truncated due to space constraints.

Need to verify if the Excel chart is actually showing only first names or if it's a display issue.
